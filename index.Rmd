## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to party identification in Texas as related to distance from the Texas/Mexico border.  The border and immigration debate which has taken over the Republican party's platform often portrays the issue as pressing and concerning for voters who live close to the border, while citizens who live farther away are more likely to take a moralistic view of the situation.  However, I would like to evaluate the extent of this truth -- as a Texan with family located in border cities and more interior towns, I can say from anecdotal evidence that this isn't always the case. I believe that using Data to inform the conversation could help to develop a more nuanced understanding of both the issue and Texan voter's opinions.
